# Learning Test Driven Development

### Brief Introduction
The motive behind Test driven development can be traced back to the waterfall model, where the requirements of the project needed to be known prior to writing code, and testing would be conducted after the code was written. This was very time consuming, which then led to models like the verification and validation model, and the Agile model. But even for Agile, even if the project is being done in small increments, the code was still being written before tests in each of these small increments. Therefore, the motive behind TDD is that tests are written before the code, and the code would need to be minimal, and written in a way to simply just pass the test cases written.

We write the test first, then the test will fail since we do not have any code implemented, then we make sure to write code just to pass the test.

We will be using **Jest**, which is a JavaScript testing framework by Facebook.

It can be installed in your react app by running this in the terminal: `npm install --save-dev jest`



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
