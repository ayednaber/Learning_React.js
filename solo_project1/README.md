# Solo Project 1 - Information Card

This is the first solo project that I am working on, where I am trying to replicate the design on Figma https://www.figma.com/file/4ctPLUvIn5b5Ep6YPOZWWd/Digital-Business-Card?node-id=0%3A1

I am using React Icons for my button icons. It is important because I am not importing a whole library, just the icons I need. Reduces the load off
of the website. https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
