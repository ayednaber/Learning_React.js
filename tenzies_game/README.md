# Tenzies Game - Project 4

In this section of the course, I will be combining the skills that I accumulated from the beginning of the course, all the way to using the most recent event listeners and hooks (useState and useEffect), and putting it all into one project.

## Objective of the Game
There are 10 die in this game, and there is a Roll button. When the die are rolled, all of them get changed into a random number, the user can click on a dice to mark it, which will make it green on the screen. This makes it so that rolling again will not impact these marked die. The objective of the game is to make all the die have the same number. Once that happens, then the user wins, and can restart the game.

### Re-rolling the die
The die numbers are being held in an array, and stored in a **useState**.
The "Roll" button will have an *onClick event listener*, where whenever it
is clicked, it will run the `setDice()` function from our useState, and
assign it to our function `allNewDice()`.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
